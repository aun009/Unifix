echo "1. For high CPU usage: Identify and limit resource-intensive processes."
echo "2. For memory issues: Consider adding more RAM or using swap more efficiently."
echo "3. For disk space issues: Clean up unnecessary files or add more storage."
echo "4. For network bottlenecks: Limit bandwidth-intensive applications."
